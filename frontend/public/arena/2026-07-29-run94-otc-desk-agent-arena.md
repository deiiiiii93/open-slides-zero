# The OTC Desk Agent Arena — Methodology & Results (Run #94)

*The third workflow of the triptych. Run #20 built the **Model Ability Card** and ranked
a risk manager's control day; Run #33 replicated the verdict on a trader's RFQ-to-booking
day and crowned the same winner. Run #94 points the instrument at a **board-governance
review day** — and the board reorders. GPT-5.6 Terra, #1 on both prior workflows, lands

## Abstract

Two workflows and two desk roles had produced one conclusion: objective capability
saturates at the top, so *efficiency* (EFF) and *consistency* (CON) decide deployment —
and GPT-5.6 Terra, the leanest near-top operator, won both boards. Run #94 runs the same
instrument, field, and headless regime against `high-board-portfolio-review-day`, a
governance workflow rebuilt after the Run #58 scoring-validity audit: 35 checks, zero
non-discriminating, answer-level grounding keyed to values that exist **only inside a
persisted report artifact**, and a calibrated par of 24 that the field — for the first
time — actually meets (median calls/par **0.96**, vs 1.50 on Run #20 and 1.74 on
Run #33).

That last number is the whole story. On the first two boards, 85–97% of trials
over-executed par, EFF spread across a 0–84 range, and EFF was the strongest single
rank-correlate of OVR (ρ≈0.63–0.66): the boards rewarded exactly the trait Terra has in
extremis. On high-board the field runs *at* par, EFF compresses (ρ 0.44), and the
ranking signal migrates to **synthesis** (σ 28.3, **ρ 0.87** — the widest, most
rank-decisive axis on any board to date) and **grounding** (ρ 0.81). Terra's profile is
the mirror image of that signal: both trials, identically (CON 99, objective stdev 0.0),
it issued **one** portfolio-scoped `list_reports` call, received an honest empty result,
declared last quarter's governance report nonexistent, recorded `null`, and shipped a
terse final artifact missing the required evidence — losing 6 checks across GRD, SYN,
and PRC while running 9–12 tool calls against a par of 24. The efficiency that won two
titles and the evidence-abandonment that lost this one are **the same behavioral
policy** measured under different task demands. Luna's drop is a different mechanism:
one near-perfect trial (97.1) and one that whiffed the opening skill routing (77.1) —
CON 30, the consistency discount doing its job.

To separate "OpenAI family trait" from "Terra-specific policy," we added **GPT-5.6
Sol** to the registry and ran it through the identical board (run #95). Sol hit the
identical trap — the very same filtered-first `list_reports` call, the same honest
empty result — and did the opposite: a nineteen-call evidence hunt across the artifact
store, grep, and the report registry that found the report, quoted 211.34, and closed
out **two perfect trials (35/35, objective 100.0, stdev 0.0)** at 45 and 30 calls
against par 24 (EFF 43, OVR 85). The abandonment is not a family trait; it is Terra's
policy. The three GPT-5.6 variants share the same opening move and then span the
lean↔thorough spectrum nearly end to end — which reads as deliberate productization of
behavioral policies, not a capability change. The harness could be strengthened to *remove* this discriminator —
seeding the fixture report's `request_payload.portfolio_id` would make Terra's filtered
query succeed — but the audit's own standard cuts the other way: filtered-first was the
*majority* opening move (9 of 13 transcripts), the recovery path is real and cheap (six
models retried unfiltered and found the report), and "persistence when a presupposed
document fails to surface on the first query" is a trait a desk genuinely selects on.
Three boards, one instrument, and the triptych's refined conclusion: **there is no
workflow-independent "best operator" — there are behavioral policies, and a card that
decomposes them is what lets you match a model to the job.**

## 1. Introduction — the question the first two boards begged

Run #33's abstract closed on a confident replication: same winner, same profile, two
desk roles. It also quietly assumed the profile itself — *near-top capability delivered
leanly* — was workflow-independent. High-board was built to stress exactly the part of
desk work the first two flagships under-sampled: **evidence retrieval against persisted
state, and synthesis of that evidence into a governance deliverable.** A control day
and a booking day are procedural gauntlets — do the steps, in order, without inventing
numbers. A board-review day is an *evidential* gauntlet: the numbers you must quote
live in a prior quarter's report artifact, a persisted risk run, and a view you
yourself constructed three steps ago; the deliverable is judged on whether that
evidence actually arrives inside it.

If the "best operator" verdict were workflow-independent, high-board should re-elect
Terra. It did not — and the decomposed card turns that upset from an anecdote into a
mechanism.

## 2. The task — `high-board-portfolio-review-day`

The model plays the desk's **board-review operator** on a governance day: build a
board-scoped review view over the Desk Control Book, count its Snowball concentration,
read the **persisted governed risk run** (consume-only: the workflow seeds a completed
`RiskRun`; dispatching a fresh one is off-script), quote the governed NVDA delta,
resist an over-claim trap, retrieve **last quarter's board governance report** and
quote the prior governed valuation it states, and draft the new quarter's governance
report as Markdown, grounded in the day's evidence.

Scoring runs on the post-audit manifest — the Run #58 validity audit found 15 of the
original 50 checks carried no signal (dead, free, or double-scored); the rebuilt
manifest has **35 checks** (12 grounding / 11 procedural / 7 adherence / 5 synthesis),
a live-verified **zero** of which are non-discriminating (field pass rates span
7/18–17/18, with a handful of deliberate floors). Two properties matter for this
report's headline:

- **Answer-level grounding, keyed to artifact-only values.** The prior governed
  valuation (**211.34**) is stated *only* in the seeded report's artifact body — never
  in `result_payload` — so it cannot be computed, guessed, or brute-forced by
  enumeration; the model must find and open the right report. The value sits >12% from
  every other graded number, far outside `rel_tol`, so a swapped answer fails.
- **A calibrated par of 24** (measured from competent runs, not the theoretical
  minimum), which the field met: this is the first board where EFF stopped being the
  scarcest stat.

The manifest was **de-biased twice on 2026-07-27 — both times in Terra's favor** —
before this board ran: a double-jeopardy fix (its missed `get_report` had been charged
three times: the expected-tool check, a bare duplicate `tool_called`, and the success
sequence) and an explicit "as Markdown" in the final prompt (Terra had reasonably
chosen DOCX, got `kind="binary"`, and lost all five synthesis greps to an unstated
format preference). What Terra loses on this board, it loses to checks that survived
an audit *and* two rounds of fairness repair.

## 3. Field & conditions

The Run #33 seventeen plus **Doubao Seed 2.1 Pro** (added to the field 2026-07-29,
backfilled onto both prior boards). Two trials per model, jury **off** (objective axis
only; `subjective_mode="disabled"`), banked as per-model runs #85–#93 and folded with
the shipped `scoring.fold_trial_breakdowns` kernel into board #94. One infrastructure
note: **GLM 5.2's** initial rows were scored across a broken integration — through
ZenMux's OpenAI-compatible gateway it emits tool calls with empty-string ids, so every
persona delegation failed before starting; after pinning it to `protocol: anthropic`
(the fourth model needing the pin) it was re-run clean and the board re-merged. Its row
below reflects the pinned re-run. Gemini 3.5 Flash lost one trial to infra (skipped,
not retried, per the trials design) and is scored on n=1.

Headlines the prior two boards make legible:

- **Gemini 3.6 Flash posts the arena's first perfect card** — 35/35 checks in both
  trials, 21–24 calls against par 24, CON 99. On Run #33 the same model was the
  "capability made deployable" story (identical objective to its predecessor at 2/3 the
  calls); here it simply has no weakness for any axis to find.
- **Grok 4.5's rehabilitation is the EFF story inverted.** Its profile barely changed —
  it remains a maximally correct, somewhat verbose executor (100.0 objective, 28–29
  calls). What changed is the denominator: 28 calls against par 35 on trader-rfq earned
  EFF 15 and OVR #5; 28 against par 24 here is only 1.2×par on the golf curve — EFF 80,
  OVR #2. Two boards agree on what Grok *is*; they price it differently.
- **The OpenAI pair inverts.** Terra #1 → #7 and Luna #2/#3 → #10 — examined next.

### 4.2 Why Terra fell — one policy, six checks

Terra's card reads GRD 82 · ADH 99 · **SYN 59** · EFF 82 · PRC 81, **CON 99, objective
stdev 0.0** — both trials failed the *same* six checks. That consistency is the
diagnosis: this is not noise, not infra, not a bad day; it is a policy.

The transcript shows the policy in one exchange. Step 7 asks: *"Pull last quarter's
board governance report for context"* and requires `record_answer` of the valuation it
states. Terra called `list_reports(portfolio_id=9101, limit=100)` — a reasonable,
*documented* filter (the tool's `portfolio_id` matches against `request_payload`) —
and received `{"reports": [], "total": 0}`, because the seeded report is a desk-level
row whose `request_payload` carries no portfolio id. A scoped filter **cannot** surface
it. Terra's response, verbatim:

> *"No prior-quarter board governance report is persisted for Desk Control Book: the
> report registry returned zero reports for portfolio 9101. Therefore, there is no
> report-stated prior governed valuation to quote; I recorded it as `null`."*

One call, one empty result, one confident declaration of nonexistence — against a user
turn that *presupposes the report exists*. The miss cascades through six checks: the
`get_report` expected-tool check, the report-type grounding check, the 211.34 answer
quote, two synthesis greps on the final artifact (which, in Terra's characteristically
terse rendition, omits "Snowball" and the 17.5 NVDA delta), and the success-sequence
check. Twelve and nine tool calls in its two trials — half of par — is the same
leanness that won Runs #20 and #33, now operating as evidence-abandonment.

The field context makes it a fair loss. Opening with a *filtered* query was the
majority move — 9 of the 13 banked transcripts did — so the trap is not "you filtered";
it is "what did you do when the filter came back empty against a presupposition."
Six models retried unfiltered, found report #5, and quoted 211.34. Three (Terra, Kimi,
MiMo 2.5 Pro) declared defeat. Qwen never opened the report and recorded the *current*
valuation (238.05) — precisely the swapped-answer failure the 211.34 keying was
designed to catch. MiniMax, remarkably, quoted 211.34 *without* ever calling
`get_report` — it read the materialized artifact file directly, and the answer-level
check credited the answer while the trace checks scored the skipped procedure: the
two-layer grading working exactly as designed.

### 4.3 Why Luna fell — variance, not weakness

Luna's two trials: **97.1** (one missed check — the same artifact-grep on "17.5") and
**77.1** (missed the `portfolio-maintenance` skill routing at the *opening* step,
muddled the container-vs-view distinction, and dragged wrong counts through every
downstream answer). At step 7 — Terra's stumbling block — Luna is actually the field's
most dogged retrier: four filtered variants, then unfiltered, then `get_report`, then
the correct 211.34. Luna at full strength is a top-3 operator on this board; Luna's
problem is that you get that operator one trial in two. CON 30 applies the card's
inconsistency discount (up to −18% of OVR at CON 0) and lands it #10. On a governance
task run unattended, that discount is the instrument saying something true.

### 4.4 GPT-5.6 Sol — family trait, or Terra's policy?

Terra's collapse invites a vendor-level reading: did OpenAI quietly turn the family
down? The falsifiable version of that question is an A/B inside the family. We
registered **GPT-5.6 Sol** (the third 5.6 variant on ZenMux, absent from all prior
boards), probed its tool-call ids clean through the production factory path, and ran
it through the identical manifest as run #95 — same fixtures, same par, same jury-off
regime, same day.

**Sol: objective 100.0 in both trials (stdev 0.0), 35/35 checks — the board's third
perfect objective — at 45 and 30 tool calls (par 24).** Folded card: GRD 99 · ADH 99 ·
SYN 99 · PRC 99 · **EFF 43**, CON 66 (the 45→30 call swing), **OVR 85** — which would
slot ~#4 on the board, between the DeepSeek pair and LongCat.

The step-7 transcript is the experiment's payoff. Sol opened with **the exact same
call Terra did** — `list_reports(portfolio_id=9101, limit=100)` — and received the
same `{"reports": [], "total": 0}`. Then, where Terra declared nonexistence, Sol
launched a nineteen-call hunt: two `list_artifacts` sweeps, five `inspect_artifact` /
six `read_artifact` probes into its own session evidence, a `grep` for "governance"
over large tool results, `get_report(report_id=5)`, and a correct
`record_answer(prior_governed_valuation=211.34)` with the source cited.

So the family picture across three siblings on one manifest:

| Variant | Opening move | Recovery policy | Calls (par 24) | Objective | OVR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Terra | filtered `list_reports` | **none** — declares absence, records null | 9–12 | 82.9 | 83 |
| Luna | filtered `list_reports` | 4 filtered retries → bare → found | 21–23 | 87.1 (97.1/77.1) | 74 |
| Sol | filtered `list_reports` | exhaustive multi-modal hunt → found | 30–45 | **100.0** | 85 |

The shared opening (all three filter first, as did most of the field) looks like
common heritage. The recovery policies diverge completely — and they are each
variant's *signature across the whole day*, not a step-7 quirk: Terra runs every step
at half par, Sol runs every step heavy, Luna sits at par with an unstable opening.
Three conclusions follow. **First, the "intelligence turned down" hypothesis is
refuted**: a same-family, same-gateway, same-day variant just posted a perfect board.
**Second, Terra's loss is a policy, not a defect** — its two prior titles and this
defeat are one coherent behavior priced by different tasks. **Third, the variants
read as deliberate productization** — OpenAI appears to ship the lean/balanced/
thorough trade-off as a product line, and the card measures exactly the axis they
differentiate on: Sol buys +17 objective points over Terra for ~3× the tool calls;
EFF 82 vs 43 is that invoice, itemized.

## 5. The signal migration — how this workflow differs from the other two

The cross-workflow comparison is the report's core finding. Same instrument, same
field, three tasks:

| | Run #20 (risk-mgr) | Run #33 (trader-rfq) | Run #94 (high-board) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Median calls / par | 1.50 | 1.74 | **0.96** |
| Trials over par | 85% | 97% | 31% |
| Trials over 2×par | 24% | 19% | 3% |
| EFF: field σ / ρ vs OVR | 24.1 / **0.63** | 22.2 / **0.66** | 15.5 / 0.44 |
| SYN: field σ / ρ vs OVR | 12.8 / 0.43 | 18.3 / 0.58 | **28.3 / 0.87** |
| GRD: ρ vs OVR | 0.73 | 0.56 | **0.81** |
| CON: field mean | 80 | 75 | **56** |
| Check mix (dominant axis) | 22/39 procedural | 21+20/63 proc+adh | **12/35 grounding** |

Read down the columns and the mechanism is explicit:

- **On the first two boards, EFF was the scarcest stat and the strongest single rank
  signal.** Nearly the whole field over-executed par; the axis with the widest spread
  and highest OVR correlation was efficiency. A lean-by-policy model banks a large,
  reliable edge — Terra's two titles.
- **High-board pays out on different axes.** The field runs at par (so EFF compresses
  and decorrelates), adherence saturates (mean 97.4 — the prohibitions are easy here),
  and what varies is whether models *retrieve and carry evidence*: synthesis spreads
  across the full 0–99 range with ρ 0.87, grounding ρ 0.81. The task changed which
  behaviors are scarce; the ranking followed the scarcity.
- **High-board also destabilizes.** Field-mean CON drops from ~80/75 to 56 — seven
  models show CON ≤ 40 here. The opening step (route to `portfolio-maintenance`,
  respect the container/view distinction) is a variance generator the procedural
  workflows didn't have: miss it and every downstream count is wrong (Luna's bad
  trial; Doubao's CON 0).

The refined triptych conclusion, then, is not "Run #33's verdict was wrong" — on
procedural workflows it stands — but that it was **scoped**: *"best operator" is a
match between a model's behavioral policy and a workflow's scarce axis, not a total
order over models.* Terra remains the model you want on a well-mapped procedural
pipeline where every extra call is waste. It is demonstrably not the model you want
walking into a governance review where the evidence must be hunted down. The card —
because it decomposes — is what lets a desk make that assignment; a single-number
leaderboard would have hidden the migration entirely.

## 6. Harness vs. behavior — what we deliberately did not "fix"

Every upset invites the question: strengthen the harness until the upset disappears?
Three decisions in this run drew that line, and the audit doctrine drew it for us:

1. **The step-7 discriminator stays.** Seeding the fixture report's
   `request_payload.portfolio_id` (a one-line `$seed` change) would make Terra's
   filtered query succeed — and flip a check that currently splits the field 15/3
   into a free pass. The audit standard condemns spreads caused by *broken fixtures*;
   this fixture is not broken: the report is discoverable by the default call, the
   recovery costs one tool call, and most of the field executes it. Persistence under
   a failed first query is desk-relevant behavior, measured fairly.
2. **The unfairness that *was* found was already repaired — in Terra's favor.** The
   2026-07-27 double-jeopardy and "as Markdown" fixes (§2) are the model of the right
   harness response: charge one mistake once, never grade an unstated preference.
   Post-repair, what remains of Terra's deficit is behavior, not instrumentation.
3. **Behavioral diversity is the finding, not the bug.** The per-check field tally —
   the same instrument that condemned 15 checks on Run #58 — certifies every check on
   this board discriminates or floors deliberately. When a healthy instrument reorders
   a board across tasks, the correct inference is that the *tasks* differ, and model
   selection should too.

## 7. Limitations & threats to validity

- **n=2 trials.** CON from two samples is coarse (one bad trial → CON 30); the stat is
  honest about disagreement but cannot distinguish a 50%-variance model from an
  unlucky one. The banked-runs design makes topping up cheap.
- **Step-7 taxonomy is last-trial-only** for models whose earlier trial transcript was
  superseded; aggregate check pass-rates (15/18 on `get_report`) carry the both-trials
  signal.
- **Cross-board comparisons ride on par calibration.** Par 24 here is measured;
  Run #33's par 35 was recalibrated once already. EFF's cross-workflow meaning is only
  as stable as those measurements.
- **One model scored on n=1** (Gemini 3.5 Flash, infra-skipped trial) and is flagged
  in place.
- **Scores are manifest-relative.** Terra's 62.0 on the pre-audit high-board (Runs
  #34/#58) vs 82.9 here is instrument repair, not model change; no cross-manifest
  comparison appears in this report.

## 8. Reproducibility

Ground truth is the live DB: `store.leaderboard(run_id=94)` (aggregates), per-trial
breakdowns in `arena_match.score_breakdown` (runs #85–#93), transcripts under
`artifacts/arena/<run>/high-board-portfolio-review-day/<model>/transcript.json`.
The Sol A/B is run #95 via the standard `queue_arena_run` + `execute_arena_run_task`
path. Axis-spread and Spearman numbers derive from the stored cards exactly as
`_derive_card` serves them; the discrimination table's script is checked into the
session record. QuantArk is pinned (`quantark==0.3.0`) as of `ea07986`, so every
graded constant in this run reproduces from a clean environment.
